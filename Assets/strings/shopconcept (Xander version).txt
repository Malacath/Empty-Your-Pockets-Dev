Strings and stuff

The shopkeeper is a man that was turned into a plant-human hybrid by Maxwell way before Wilson arrived into the Don't Starve world, he, without anything better to do, built a shop around himself using his roots, he waits for people trapped by Maxwell to pass by his shop so he can help them, and get some silver by doing so, of course.

I need lines for when you examine the things below [Shopkeeper, Upgrade area, item area, luckscrapyard, and mission area, Wilson's lines are already done but i do need more lines for other characters.

Shopkeeper

The Shopkeeper is friendly, but he is also greedy at times,he's really interested in the player's victory. And his silver, of course.

I need lines for him introducing himself (INTRODUCTION_GENERIC) for various characters. 6 for each one. 

I also need lines for when the character is replaced for another one (Adventure mode ending), and for when he is attacked by the player. You're free to write some more stuff for different situations, if you feel like.
