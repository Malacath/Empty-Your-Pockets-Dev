I just found out that we can even modify the worldgen screen. You know, the part where the little planet turns around and the shadowhands wail. I'd suggest that we put something there suggesting the arena like nature of the underworld. And maybe even change the shadowhands, it can really be anything since we can insert our own animations. Maybe you're more creative than me though  ; )  -Hanno

Huh. I'll see what i could do for this. -Irontaco

But it's really more for polishing the thing up, first things first  ^^  We'll also need punny verbs and subjectives to create things like "Insuating a keen sense of despair" -Hanno

We could have a very-community-feel set of verbs and adjectives.Like this :

Underworld:

Verbs

Creating
Modding
Procrastinating
Animating
Coding
Bugging
Glitching
Barely working on
Composing

Subjectives

a proper arena layout
the Announcer
spiders
bats
spawners
a tense atmosphere of danger
spookyness
a endless void that stares back
dimension travelling that doesn't rip apart reality
duty-ish music

Hell:

Verbs

Burning
Making harder
Brainstorming
Testing
Breaking
Putting more difficulty into

Subjectives

a harder arena
some bloody hot temperatures
bloody bosses everywhere
a hellish place where the moist in your eyes boils
[let's be honest you're gonna die in here]
the place where good ol' Satan sleeps in
a terrible sense of hopelesness

-Irontaco
