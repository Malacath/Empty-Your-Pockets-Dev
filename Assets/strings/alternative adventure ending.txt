Will William Carter ever be freed? This is not your business anymore. You prefer to forget this has ever happened.

You desperately try to find a light in this vast void, but there's nothing.

It's empty.

Before you sit down and accept that the curtains have closed, you look at the dark sky.

You've saved someone, at least, Maxwell can possibly do something, right? He's a magician, after all.

You think it better, Maxwell will probably do his promise. But what does it matter. You will die in here.

The cycle of life continues and William Carter is not part of it anymore.
