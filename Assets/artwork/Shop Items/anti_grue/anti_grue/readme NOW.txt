anti_grue and anti_grue_on are inventory images which i didn't quite figure out how to make work.

the ON states are for when the anti grue is working.

when on it should emit light from the lightbulb itself if it's on and on the ground.

be sure to resize the on ground image to 1.3 each side so it looks bigger and has a bigger clickeable area.

i'm gonna be working on all shop images from now on until i run out of shop item prefabs to work on.
