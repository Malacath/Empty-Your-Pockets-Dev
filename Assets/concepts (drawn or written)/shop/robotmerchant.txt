New Merchant Concepts:

 - After the merchant is unlocked as a playable character, his music device gains minor sentience and constructs an automaton made from a wooden dummy/scarecrow, and misc. musical/machine parts.

 - It resembles the merchant slightly, but in a crude way. It wears a similar jacket, and it's post is painted green. The head should be the speaker from an Edison Phonograph. A record player should be connected somehwere on it, and bits of pipes/accordians/other musical devices attached rather sloppily onto it.

 - It's speaking tune should be a messy collection of notes from other instruments. Also, it should have the robotic tune of WX-78.

 - If it had an actual voice, imagine a collection of intruments and machinery playing sounds to replicate human speech.

 - Some possible quotes:

"GREETINGS, BUDDY."

"WELCOME TO THE SHOP, BOY-O."

"YOUR BUSINESS IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, SLICKER."

"PLEASE ENJOY OUR VAST COLLECTION OF WARES, BRO."

"DUDE, OUR DISCOUNTS ARE FIGURATIVELY TIGHT."

"IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR AESTHETICS, PLEASE SIT DOWN ON THE BED."

So on and so forth.
