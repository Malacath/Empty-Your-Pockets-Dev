Anyway, as far as my part is concerned I agree..   I'm just super busy with my thesis and my personal life that there is simply no time right now to code.. But I want to get back to it for sure..

I took some time to finish another projects over here myself, i hope we can get to work togheter soon, but! Once i finish most of my things (two small GMOD maps) i will start working on the art again and this time i'll finish as many things as i can so work is easier. Sorry for being so lazy on my part.

I still think we may need some extra help with this mod so once again i was thinking of doing a thread in the Klei forums since there's some really great dudes in there.

Yeah well.. Like you know ther's like 0.0001% of my time I could invest in modding. So if you want some progress you should probably go ahead and search for a good coder..
